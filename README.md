# Key insights from the study include:
1. 72% of Gen Z prioritize alignment with a company's mission over salary, highlighting their desire for meaningful work.
2. Over 50% expect starting salaries above 50K INR, underlining the importance of competitive compensation.
3. Workplace flexibility scored an 8/10, making hybrid/remote models a necessity rather than a perk.
4. 81% expressed a need for regular mental health support, emphasizing the importance of work-life balance.

# Conclusion:
To present these findings effectively, I created interactive dashboards and collaborated with stakeholders to recommend actionable strategies, such as enhancing workplace flexibility and fostering learning opportunities. These insights have the potential to increase employee retention by up to 18.31% when implemented thoughtfully.
